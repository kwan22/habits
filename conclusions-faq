## Closing Thoughts

Habits cap out as we approach higher levels of gameplay. In chess, a lot of the higher level learning becomes learning when to break the habits. My opinion is that in Celeste, further learning becomes paying attention to increasingly granular levels of detail, and trying to rely only on the fundamentals becomes limited.

Reflecting on the goals of the habits, the early levels started with developing mastery of the basic inputs, followed by learning to use speed tech. None of the speed tech is highly technical to perform: mainly learning the extension timing requires learning an arbitrary muscle-memory. Speed tech is only ever used in the context of having a plan or setup, and is only as hard as the setup demands.

Later levels focused on developing strats with consistency and keeping an open eye for optimizing movement. Level 4 began to dive into some of the more granular details, but my intent was to focus on movement themes that are commonly recurring to build pattern recognition.

Thank you for reading and (presumably) watching the series. I hope you found this both entertaining and instructive.

## FAQ

**Q: Why is x at habit level y? It should be in habit level z!**  
*A: Maybe, there's no one way to build a habits series. These just reflect my personal take and values on how to incrementally improve on the fundamentals. I think I did a pretty good job and being self-consistent.*

**Q: Why aren't you doing x strat at habit level y? It's easier and faster!**  
*A: Because I don't care about the time, I want to emphasize skillset development. If you find a different strat that you think is easier and faster, go ahead and do it.*

**Q: That strat was nice but you could have optimized it better by doing this.**  
*A: Sure, maybe I was aware of that, maybe I wasn't. If I intentionally excluded it, then I decided it wasn't worth the level of detail to explain in a fundamentals-based approach. If I didn't know about it...well hopefully it didn't egregiously violate any of the habits. I want to say I have a good enough grasp of the game where this might pop up occasionally but not be a major issue.*

**Q: Why not play 5b from Level 1? Why bother spending time learning 5a if we're just switching to 5b at Level 4?**  
*A: There is some merit to this idea, and a habits series could be viable starting with 5b from Level 1, but my justifications are the following:*
1. 5b presents too high of a barrier to entry in terms of the precision platforming.
2. 5b requires niche tech (pause-buffering, neutral spikejump) to save time over 5a. I originally did not want to ever introduce pause-buffering as it's a textbook example of only being useful in extremely niche situations. However, I decided that pause-buffering is still a useful skill to have and muscle memory to learn.
3. Search reverse super is a nice gateway to learning extension timing, just like how bubsdrop can be a gateway to learning more complex pause strats like 3a fast demo and 4a 2nd blockless.
4. With good fundamentals at Level 3, skills are transferable and learning 5b is not that different from learning new strats in 5a.

**Q: 6b when?**  
*A: Barrier to entry is simply too high. A habits run of 6b would mostly look like a casual playthrough with a "try not to die" mentality.*

**Q: This doesn't seem like a very efficient way of learning the speedrun. Why are we spending so much time not doing tech or learning setups?**  
*A: Depends on what you mean by efficient. You can maybe get faster times with less practice & learning by jumping straight to the hard stuff and monkey-brain copying strats and movement. My experience is that this usually only works if you have prior experience in speedrunning and learning how to learn. The goal of the habits is not about getting the fastest possible time, after all. Taking a long time to build a strong foundation.*

**Q: The goal of speedrunning is to get the fastest possible time. Why isn't this a goal of the habits?**  
*A: Because my opinion is that speedrunning Celeste is a performing art, and the final time you get is secondary. Without going into too much detail: time of course is important when selecting strats, learning movement, and developing a plan. These are implicitly considered as we build the habits to improve our speed, consistency, and optimize movement. Let the time follow your personal growth, no need to chase after the times.*
