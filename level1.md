## Level 1

Level 1 is meant to simulate a player that has just completed a casual playthrough of the base game and wants to immediately jump into speedrunning. They likely have collected some berries here and there, maybe found a few cassettes and blue hearts, but have not played any B-sides or Farewell. Thus, they have not been introduced to any of the game-taught speed tech and thus this level will reflect that.

#### No tech: jump, dash, and grab  
The goal here is to build mastery of the three fundamental actions of Celeste gameplay. Some mastery of these actions is demanded to complete the base game in the first place. Here, the goal is to really solidify that mastery and prove we can handle all the challenges of each room.

#### Plan for every room  
One of the staples of Celeste speedrunning advice for beginners. Every action should be done with intent, and learning is done by repetition. At level 1, this will be generally more vague, such as "reach this platform," "grab this wall," or "wait for Oshiro to pass," etc. As the levels rise, these become more detailed and nuanced.

*Present example strats of some rooms, e.g. 2a badeline final, 3a suite final, 4a cliff face last snowball, 5a unraveling final, rescue 2 seeker room, last seeker*

#### Useful things-to-know  
These include miscellaneous details about game mechanics that require no technical precision and are easy to save time with. This includes skipping cutscenes, confirming deaths, transitions refilling dashes (3a start 1st key, 2k top route), and retrying with keys (shaft, 2500m).
