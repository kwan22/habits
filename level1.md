## Level 1

Level 1 is meant to simulate a player that has just completed a casual playthrough of the base game and wants to immediately jump into speedrunning. They likely have collected some berries here and there, maybe found a few cassettes and blue hearts, but have not played any B-sides or Farewell. They have not been introduced to any of the game-taught speed tech and these rules will reflect that.

#### No tech: jump, dash, and grab  
The goal here is to build mastery of the three fundamental actions of Celeste gameplay. Some mastery of these actions is demanded to complete the base game in the first place. Here, the goal is to solidify that mastery and prove we can consistently handle all the challenges of each room.

#### Plan for every room  
One of the staples of Celeste speedrunning advice for beginners. Every action should be done with intent, and learning is done by repetition. At level 1, this will be generally more vague, such as "reach this platform," "grab this wall," "wait for Oshiro to pass," "stun the seeker here," etc. As the levels rise, these become more detailed and nuanced.

#### Useful things-to-know  
These include miscellaneous details about game mechanics that require little to no technical precision and are easy to save time with. This includes routing knowledge, skipping cutscenes, confirming deaths, transitions refilling dashes, and retrying with keys.

#### Examples

The plan for the last few coins in the Badeline chase sequence is to never cross your own path.

Transitions refill dashes!

The "red dot": be aware of when Oshiro is about to charge and ensure you have space to dodge. Whether your strat is able to line up with the Oshiro cycles shown in the clips depends on your movement: apply the red-dot principle to whatever Oshiro cycle you end up settling upon.

  Generally, horizontal dashing cuts through strong wind much better than updiagonal dashes

Learn to feel comfortable with stunning a charging seeker. Similar to the Oshiro red-dot: seekers are much smaller and easier to jump over, so stunning them gives you several seconds of free movement. Generally try to not let seekers approach you from above: letting them approach you from below or horizontally is much more reliable in jumping on top of them.

Avoid confronting a seeker from below, even if it means approaching the seeker intentionally (cue Jojo and Star Wars memes).

Stunning a seeker while carrying Theo is a bit trickier since you don't have the luxury of jumping high and then dashing down. A small jump just before the seeker reaches you works well when the seeker is not charging you from above.

The red-dot principle still applies.

No shame in sending Theo first.

No shame in spending some time making sure the seeker is stunned if you missed it the 1st time.

  There are 6 route forks between top and bottom routes in Hollows. The 1st and last forks are relatively inconsequential (bottom for 1st fork and top for last fork are generally recommended, pick your favorite), but forks 2-5 should be prescribed.

Go top on both 2nd and 3rd forks.

In the large falling room in Reflection (the checkpoint), do not take the 2nd shortcut, it skips a mid-room checkpoint (and is not fast when taking the 3rd shortcut).
