## Level 4

Level 4 begins a deeper dive into some of the fundamentals of movement as well as more detailed inner workings of game mechanics and niche situations in which these arise. Situations become more specific and technical: understanding the inner workings is not required to execute the strats, but the details are not obviously available to a player without researching game mechanics and physics. Concepts start to become increasingly complicated, so several examples are provided for illustration.

#### Conscious of bottlenecks  
A general understanding of what bottlenecks are. This is usually divided between resolving a horizontal vs vertical bottleneck, but can also be dictated by other factors such as activating a block. Awareness and some principles to reducing airtime are included. The goal is to be conscious of these: some are difficult to greed and optimize well and may compromise consistency, but having awareness of these provides us with guidance on what the limits are.

#### Selecting super or hyper for more vertical vs horizontal  
- Crossing 6
- 3a start post triplat

#### Wallkick/wallbouncing timing for vertical vs horizontal movement  
- *Vertical:* 1a chasm2, 2a start ending, 3a boxes final, 5b start final  
- *Horizontal:* 1a start 5, chasm left wall, 4a start (updemo), 3a towels final, 7a 1000m transition wallbounces

#### Minimizing needing to re-accelerate in the bottlenecked direction  
- 1a crossing-7: late dash to first zipper
- 2a intervention near top: transition hyper to avoid colliding w/ jumpthru
- 3a shaft entering demo room: instant hyper and hold jump
- 5b depths first button: upright demo to avoid bonk to land earlier

#### Getting crumble blocks to disappear with a wave/ext hyper  
- 2a intervention
- 5b cc pre spikejump
- 7a 0m 2crystal room: bkgd tile border for updash cue
- 7a 2500m fast key

#### Know the speed hierarchy  
This goes hand in hand with being conscious of bottlenecks. Know some of the nuanced properties of dashes, wallbounces, jumps, etc. Emphasis that dashing downwards, especially diagdown, can be deceptively slow for vertical bottleneck.  
If you updash near a wall, prefer wallbounce over climbjumping unless absolutely necessary (e.g., 5a tape room).

- 1a crossing-3, 7a 500m-2 right dash 
- 1a chasm2 ending
- 2a start near-end wallbounce
- 3a boxes final wallbounce
- 4a trail/cliff face wallbounces
- 5b cc-1 cornerglide
- 6a rb last badeline: instant hyper over ext hyper ultra
- 7a 1000m-2: dj upright, transition wallbounce (ties into dashcd)
- 7a 0m orb early right dash, fast fall
- 7a 0m orb: bkgd cue for left dash
- 7a 2500m avoid upright along the wall
- 7a 2500m door: only 1 downright

#### DashCD control  
Awareness of DashCD and movement to intentionally avoid or retain DashCD for setups. Selection of instant hyper, hyper bhop, vs ext-hyper. Buffering dashes out of DashCD, related to grounded ultra timing. Managing DashCD from vertical transitions (canceling vertical momentum, 3a-suite cutscene delay) and developing intuition for buffering out of vertical DashCD.

- 2a start before mirror: ext hyper
- 4a 1st block ultra
- 5b pillarful: ext hyper
- 6a hollows kevin slide
- 7a 1500m entering 1-coin room
- 7a 2500m cornerglide
- 7a 2500m orb entry springskip

#### Option-selecting movement  
Making decisions to cover multiple possible outcomes in case something unexpected happens with movement

#### Holding into the wall for wallkicks for forcemove  
- 3a start post triplat: hold left for wallkick
- 7a 3k flag14: wallkick while holding left

#### Using dash-attack leniency on wallbounces to hold toward a wall  
- 3a suite-1
- 4a start final
- 7a 500m-1

#### Pressing extra buttons to cover unexpected scenarios  
General cornerkicks: 2 jump inputs to cover weird timing  
Holding grab in case of missed landings  
- 3a shaft 1st berry room ending
- 7a 2000m pre-orb

#### Simple pausebuffer timing  
Learning to buffer the pause at the start of 2a-Intervention and 3a-Suite segways into learning bubsdrop. This will be the only pausebuffer strat learned in the habits, but also acts as a gateway for learning more complicated pausebuffer strats for those who wish to go further.
