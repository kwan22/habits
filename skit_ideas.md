## Some Skit Ideas for Fun

- 2 jump button demonstration and try using SirNewt 27 any% example (3a shaft-1), get bamboozled, maybe parallel to h3 snorkel
- Hypering in awake-1 (game checkpoint) and getting stuck on walls -> hypering for no reason (parallel to RPM), no criticism of it until lv 4
- Lv 2 hypering for no reason in awake in a way that loses time to level 1 movement by less bonking on walls and springs, while proclaiming "we must be faster than before now that we're hypering" and then show side-by-side comparison
- Get destroyed by towels 2+3 in lv 1 habits like Bxh3 sacs, pop off when we easily handle it in level 2
- Oshiro,seekers - parallel to red dot at level 1&2
- Suite-2 cutscene at lv3, complain about invisible dashcd that wasnt there before, explain in lv 4
- Oshiro final and/or towels 2: struggle with differences in entry vs death cycle at lv 2, attempt to learn a death cycle, brain blast trying to do death cycle on entry, decide to revert to level 1
- "Statistical anomaly" get owned by roof tile clip and oshiro freezeframe in suite-4 in lv 2 or 3, revisit in lv4 about optimizing dash to the coin
- Get owned by game-forced hypers/supers (6a rb trying to hyper while crouched in coyote becomes a super, downleft to crumble buffered super becomes a hyper)
- Paid chatter asking about 5b, 6b, no demo weirdge, other strat backseaters
- Using search skip "spacing" as a way to learn "extension timing" that is technically incorrect but parallels wavedash.ppt in Farewell
- Insist on ultras being easy to perform in a vacuum with good binds (lv 2 habits!!), criticize using face buttons only, share personal story of how both hand health and controller longevity improved dramatically when I switched to independent dash and jump binds
- 5b cc final updash: pretend to use flawed logic to setup 5f window (like apparent RPM but is actually a strong move), discuss how habits can't cover higher levels of learning with weird niche setups
