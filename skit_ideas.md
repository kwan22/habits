## Some Skit Ideas for Fun

- 2 jump button demonstration and try using SirNewt 27 any% example (3a shaft-1), get bamboozled, maybe parallel to h3 snorkel
- Hypering in awake-1 (game checkpoint) and getting stuck on walls -> hypering for no reason (parallel to RPM), no criticism of it until lv 4
- Lv 2 hypering for no reason in awake in a way that loses time to level 1 movement by less bonking on walls and springs, while proclaiming "we must be faster than before now that we're hypering" and then show side-by-side comparison
- Oshiro,seekers - parallel to red dot at level 1&2
- Oshiro final: struggle with differences in entry vs death cycle at lv 2, attempt to learn a death cycle, brain blast trying to do death cycle on entry, decide to revert to level 1
- "Statistical anomaly" get owned by roof tile clip and oshiro freezeframe in suite-4 in lv 2 or 3, revisit in lv4 about optimizing dash to the coin
- Get owned by game-forced hypers/supers (6a rb trying to hyper while crouched in coyote becomes a super, downleft to crumble buffered super becomes a hyper)
- Lv 2 learning how to hyper based on 8c tutorial: try pressing dash and jump at the same time, get owned sometimes, perform perturbation analysis (which one to press first?), discuss how this 'sensitivity analysis' type logic can be applied for general troubleshooting. "Something isn't working, should I be pressing the button earlier or later?"
- Paid chatter asking about 5b, 6b, no demo weirdge, other strat backseaters
- Using search skip "spacing" as a way to learn "extension timing" that is technically incorrect but parallels wavedash.ppt in Farewell
- Insist on ultras being easy to perform in a vacuum with good binds (lv 2 habits!!), criticize using face buttons only, share personal story of how both hand health and controller longevity improved dramatically when I switched to independent dash and jump binds
- 5b cc final updash: pretend to use flawed logic to setup 5f window (like apparent RPM but is actually a strong move), discuss how habits can't cover higher levels of learning with weird niche setups

## Clips from Chessbrah building habits

A collection of moments I thought were both entertaining and instructive that inspired me to develop this series for Celeste and I thought would have parallels to building Celeste fundamentals.

- [First time seeing scholar's mate](https://youtu.be/K82MVHQjmZ4?si=mXKQlYyeVG5gDUg-&t=117)
- [Intro to red dot](https://youtu.be/K82MVHQjmZ4?si=AchsHCyqKnHZkPJN&t=1717)

- ["Why are you trading pieces when you're down material?" game at Lv 1 that wins the endgame](https://youtu.be/K82MVHQjmZ4?si=IpVoX1hOJ76fUG0T&t=2834)
- [Diagnosing fried liver, keep it simple instead of going into anti-fried liver theory](https://youtu.be/K82MVHQjmZ4?si=C-91wppXCeCL2gWd&t=2995)
- [Gradually learning to play 'anti-habits moves' (knight away from the center) to deal with niche situations (Bxh6 sac)](https://youtu.be/nVimLD6wMUw?si=-pjFvQhtRjoYUzgH&t=1262)
- [Need to practice tactics before learning how to use them (need to practice strats before learning them)](https://youtu.be/nVimLD6wMUw?si=nTwrvXfBbsFILcKM&t=3175)
- [Habits playing Bc4 into Sicilian](https://youtu.be/tKXDFThCqTs?si=akXqH6UnM7Lvj89C&t=213) even though Aman has [his own video about why that's a bad move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4F0MnbxesQ), but sticking to the habits anyway to be instructive about habits principle of developing towards the center.
- [It's ok to miss tactics, focus on high-percentage moves when building fundamentals](https://youtu.be/tKXDFThCqTs?si=gR_lIEpsnhii3a4J&t=2133): it might feel bad to miss a tactic because you stuck to the habits, but you're not realizing the number of bad moves you're avoiding thanks to the habits.
- [NEVER RESIGN](https://youtu.be/tKXDFThCqTs?si=5YXbJHAIfn6tRKt5&t=2436) (800 elo down a piece)
- [Chat backseaters misunderstanding the series](https://youtu.be/tKXDFThCqTs?si=q9Uvedl3fxGqRIvV&t=2939): no need to sweat trying to find the best move every single turn (also check 51:10).
- [Statistical anomaly turning into a recurring pattern](https://youtu.be/Roo2r_1zLP4?si=l_hEioFk5-Ac9UfB&t=241): coordinated kingside attack usually involving B+Q.
- [Backseaters finding a fork gone wrong](https://youtu.be/Roo2r_1zLP4?si=yd7Kxb3tsJ-Ox70N&t=914)
- [Opponent resigns when losing a pawn??](https://youtu.be/Roo2r_1zLP4?si=fX0h0nqwdmnXLiZ-&t=1061) Like resetting in city.
- [Being petty about being forced to make a good move](https://youtu.be/Roo2r_1zLP4?si=VBm3GBQlx0y5zasV&t=1168) like being annoyed by backseaters even though they are suggesting good advice.
- [Opponent throwing a winning/drawn position by trying to be too fancy](https://youtu.be/Roo2r_1zLP4?si=Qa6LvCVOgUBAhm92&t=2022)
- [First game of the day, don't sweat it too much](https://youtu.be/FFVG_LqACiU?si=YVvjj3lxsCqbT6QQ&t=226)
- [Backseaters: "Why not Qg4?"](https://youtu.be/FFVG_LqACiU?si=lh3bYXEo0PovsWFS&t=1477), check full VOD version too
- [Another case of opponent trying to be too fancy](https://youtu.be/FFVG_LqACiU?si=0S_z2NmmiXirU5Mx&t=2327)
- [Opponents keep resigning before you can practice endgame checkmate pattern](https://youtu.be/FFVG_LqACiU?si=0S_z2NmmiXirU5Mx&t=2327), funny inverse parallel where in speedruns, excessive resetting often leads to insufficient lategame practice.
- [No need to be a hero, the difference between you and your opponent at 1100 elo is not 1 pawn](https://youtu.be/M_v0of2gduY?si=1Qrcx3G4StSEXqjE&t=1025)
- [No tactics at lv 1, focus on where the pieces belong](https://youtu.be/M_v0of2gduY?si=fXAO-Yw6b-jY9E7F&t=1403)
- [Player that doesn't understand the fundamentals of the game](https://youtu.be/M_v0of2gduY?si=SgiE7mSvwf613OI6&t=1683)
- [Bit about finding a tactic that doesn't actually work, mald at lv 3 habits](https://youtu.be/M_v0of2gduY?si=Qb10SOgEsToJsOcx&t=2170)
- [Incremental improvment of understanding as the habits levels rises](https://youtu.be/buguYn2gKYM?si=K2jGivXtJd478po5&t=836) (making use of a pin)
- [Statistical anomaly getting checkmated in the middle of the board](https://youtu.be/buguYn2gKYM?si=hvmachNkgoDwcOUv&t=1867), not worth spending time overanalyzing
- [Backseaters promoting ladder mate being a "free strat" but it doesn't always work b/c of some specific situations](https://youtu.be/U0ZIb6SlKd0?si=WfixGUkujrDzeAuL&t=1973)
- [Avoiding playing 'winning moves' (pawn fork involving pawn in front of king) b/c they overcomplicate the position, allow counterplay, and we've been burned before](https://youtu.be/U0ZIb6SlKd0?si=0gJ_VtfoOEgtg-GR&t=2541) (feels similar to going for risky 2fs to me)
