## Some Skit Ideas for Fun

- 2 jump button demonstration and try using SirNewt 27 any% example (3a shaft-1), get bamboozled, maybe parallel to h3 snorkel
- Hypering in awake-1 (game checkpoint) and getting stuck on walls -> hypering for no reason (parallel to RPM), no criticism of it until lv 4
- Oshiro,seekers - parallel to red dot at level 1
- Oshiro final: struggle with differences in entry vs death cycle at lv 2, attempt to learn a death cycle, brain blast trying to do death cycle on entry, decide to revert to level 1
- "Statistical anomaly" get owned by roof tile clip and oshiro freezeframe in suite-4 in lv 2 or 3, revisit in lv4 about optimizing dash to the coin
- Paid chatter asking about 5b, 6b, no demo weirdge
- Trying to instant hyper and pressing jump-dash instead of dash-jump, learning to apply sensitivity analysis (naively believe pressing jump+dash together results in super, find it doesn't always work, try perturbing timings and see what happens)
- Insist on ultras being easy to perform in a vacuum with good binds (lv 2 habits!!), criticize using face buttons only, share personal story of how both hand health and controller longevity improved dramatically when I switched to independent dash and jump binds
- 5b cc final updash: pretend to use flawed logic to setup 5f window (like apparent RPM but is actually a strong move), discuss how habits can't cover higher levels of learning with weird niche setups
