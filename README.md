# Building Habits: Improving on the Fundamentals of Celeste Speedrunning

---

## Introduction

*"Building habits" is originally a YouTube series from Grandmaster Aman Hambleton (Chessbrah) as both an educational and entertaining method to gradually improve at chess. Aman follows a strict set of rules to simulate playing at various levels of gameplay, from complete beginner to a fairly advanced level (0-2000 ELO). The rules are centered purely around the fundamental principles of playing good moves. The goal is not to always be playing optimally or win every game, but to focus on "high-percentage" moves that are usually but not always good. As the rating rises, the rules change to reflect the increase in the player's strength. Eventually, the habits series concludes at around 2000 ELO as the fundamentals can only take you so far, and attention to niche details and specific variations becomes increasingly important.*

*(insert link and graphic of the chess habits, refer to parallels)*

As a casual chess enjoyer and dedicated Celeste speedrunner, I've been inspired to attempt to apply this philosophy towards Celeste speedrunning. My approach to learning is also largely rooted in learning the fundamentals first before learning to break them. In summary, the goals of the Celeste habits are to:

- Master basic movement mechanics in increments
- Develop transferable skillsets and knowledge of movement
- Pattern recognition of common setups for consistency
- Throttle intake of information

Note that "getting the fastest time we can" or anything along those lines is **not** an explicit goal of the habits. The philosophy here is that fast times will naturally follow upon mastery of the fundamentals. Just like in the chess habits, there will be 4 levels of habits, starting from a complete beginner, and compounding on skills and concepts learned in previous levels.

*(maybe screenshot of RandomName talking about my bingo routing following basic principles)*

All levels of the habits will follow two overarching principles:

### 1. Basic setups  
### 2. Never reset

**Basic setups** refer to a setup that is simple to understand and easy to replicate at the corresponding level. The specifics of a setup can range from a broad action such as "wait for Oshiro to pass" or a more refined detail such as "line up on this corner." Niche setups that require specific knowledge that has no direct application anywhere else are avoided (e.g., 4a cpop). Whether these niche strats are good or not is irrelevant if they are not instructive to the fundamental principles.

**Never reset** is simple: the goal of the habits is to develop skillsets and knowledge, not to chase good filetimes. Resetting for a good pace is simply a waste of time in this context. We are here to play the game to learn the basics, evaluate if we are truly consistent at our strat selection, and diagnose patterns of strats that are repeat offenders of going wrong. The end time we achieve is completely irrelevant.

Lastly, as a teaser, I will introduce the first habit:

### Level 0  
**Have fun.**

That's it, but really, this is probably the most critical habit to have. Everyone has their own meaning of what fun is and how they want to play the game. The rest of the habits will reflect my own values and skills I want to see in my own speedrunning. Enjoy.

## Level 1

Level 1 is meant to simulate a player that has just completed a casual playthrough of the base game and wants to immediately jump into speedrunning. They likely have collected some berries here and there, maybe found a few cassettes and blue hearts, but have not played any B-sides or Farewell. Thus, they have not been introduced to any of the game-taught speed tech and thus this level will reflect that.

*(graphic)*

#### No tech: jump, dash, and grab  
The goal here is to build mastery of the three fundamental actions of Celeste gameplay. Some mastery of these actions is demanded to complete the base game. Here, the goal is to really solidify that mastery and prove we can handle all the challenges of each room.

#### Moving hazard patterns  
This primarily focuses on Oshiro, snowballs, and seekers. The plan here is to be able to handle them when they become dangerous. For Oshiro and seekers, it is to know when they are charging and to bonk them on demand. For snowballs, it is sufficient to simply know when they are coming and get out of the way before making progress.

#### Plan for every room  
One of the staples of Celeste speedrunning advice for beginners. Every action should be done with intent, and learning is done by repetition. At level 1, this will be generally more vague, such as "reach this platform," "grab this wall," or "wait for Oshiro to pass," etc. As the levels rise, these become more detailed and nuanced.

#### Ignore statistical anomalies  
The "statistical anomaly": taken from the chess series, this refers to a problem that suddenly arises. We will follow the same approach: if a strat breaks once during a run, we will chalk it up to a statistical anomaly. If we start chronically missing execution, we will perform a deeper investigation and re-evaluate our strat selection.

#### Useful things-to-know  
These include miscellaneous details about game mechanics that require no technical expertise and are easy to save time with. This includes skipping cutscenes, confirming deaths, transitions refilling dashes, and retrying with keys.

---

## Level 2

Level 2 is meant to simulate a player that has likely already dabbled in speedrunning Celeste and wants to take it more seriously. Perhaps they have completed all the chapters or even 100%'d the game. Here, we nominally unleash the basic speed tech taught in the game. Use of speedrun tool is recommended.

#### Basic dash tech  
This includes supers, hypers, wallbounces, and wavedashes. I specify wavedash here as it is taught in Farewell, while extended hypers are not. A small but key distinction: we will not know the timing for extensions.  
The one and only exception to this will be the reverse super in Search. This will be our launching pad to learn extension timing in the future.

#### Basic entity tech  
This includes dream jumps, fastbubbling, using bubbles as dashes, archie, and setups for liftboost in ways not seen in Level 1 (think of block hyper in Shrine).

#### One cycle only  
Retransition if possible to reset the entry cycle. The goal is to reinforce learning of the entry cycle via repetition and avoid having to learn different strats for the same room. (If re-entry is not possible, revert to level 1, reveal as part of a skit?)

#### Good, ergonomic binds  
This means having dash (or demo), 2 jump binds, and grab on keys that can all be pressed and released independently of each other. This also means we will be using the 2 jump buttons for any vertical movement.  
I considered putting this in level 1, but decided to keep the controls as basic as possible in Level 1. The idea here is to take the effort to set more complex binds outside the minimum requirements should target those that are getting ready to take the game more seriously.

---

## Level 3

Level 3 rounds out most of the RTA-viable speed tech that most speedrunners will ever encounter. We emphasize a selection of strats with speed generation/conservation, and finding ways to perform them in a consistent manner via normalization. Use of speedrun tool is highly recommended.

#### Extension timing  
Perhaps the true bread and butter of Celeste speed tech. If you have to pick one arbitrary rhythm/timing in this game for speedrunning, it is this timing. Mastery of the reverse super from Level 2 should have built the dash-to-jump timing into muscle memory that we now utilize more broadly.

#### Ultras, cbs, demos, neutrals, cornerkicks  
Some scary words for beginners but none of these are actually difficult if you know extension timing. We are just starting to implement some setups to use these where they are most friendly to being consistent.

- **Ultras:** 2a start, awake, 3a hub1, boxes1, 4a start, 2nd block ultra 5a depths-1
- **Demos:** 2a awake, 3a shaft 8f setup
- **Neutrals:** 1a chasm, 6a hollows
- **Cornerkick:** 1a chasm, 2a intervention, 4a shrine, 7a 500m, 3000m

#### Active movement  
No more entering a room and then starting movement, movement exiting a room should consciously chain into the next room. Cycles should also become largely irrelevant when strats are well executed (many cycle rooms in 3a, 1500m; many transition super/hyper/wallbounce).

#### Use visual cues  
Helps tie down timings to obvious and easily memorizable background objects.  
*(show some easy visual cues)*

#### Normalization with leniency  
The goal is to make strats more consistent. The transition hyper and wallbounce will be the most common for using the buffer system and introducing normalization. Other movement and setups that emphasize using the buffer system include spikejumps, dream hypers/doublejumps, and pausing for some cutscene skips.  
Cornercorrection is a mechanic that will be naturally used at all levels, but here we will intentionally use it to mostly emphasize that 3-tile jumps line up well for midair supers, and both 1- and 2-tile hypers line up well with midair supers (or demohypers) because of cornercorrection. Jumpthrough cornercorrection leniency is also demonstrated. This is also a place to learn the timing for dashing out of max height and not releasing jump while doing so.

- **Cornercorrection:** 1a start-1, 2a start+awake, 3a shaft final, 3a suite final, 4a cliff face-2, 5a rescue-3, 6a resolution, 7a flag1

## Level 4

Level 4 begins a deeper dive into some of the fundamentals of movement as well as more detailed inner workings of game mechanics and niche situations in which these arise. Situations become more specific and technical: understanding the inner workings is not required to execute the strats, but the details are not obviously available to a player without researching game mechanics and physics. Concepts start to become increasingly complicated, so several examples are provided for illustration.

#### Conscious of bottlenecks  
A general understanding of what bottlenecks are. This is usually divided between resolving a horizontal vs vertical bottleneck, but can also be dictated by other factors such as activating a block. Awareness and some principles to reducing airtime are included. The goal is to be conscious of these: some are difficult to greed and optimize well and may compromise consistency, but having awareness of these provides us with guidance on what the limits are.

#### Selecting super or hyper for more vertical vs horizontal  
- Crossing 6
- 3a start post triplat

#### Wallkick/wallbouncing timing for vertical vs horizontal movement  
- *Vertical:* 1a chasm2, 2a start ending, 3a boxes final, 5b start final  
- *Horizontal:* 1a start 5, chasm left wall, 4a start (updemo), 3a towels final, 7a 1000m transition wallbounces

#### Minimizing needing to re-accelerate in the bottlenecked direction  
- 1a crossing-7: late dash to first zipper
- 2a intervention near top: transition hyper to avoid colliding w/ jumpthru
- 3a shaft entering demo room: instant hyper and hold jump
- 5b depths first button: upright demo to avoid bonk to land earlier

#### Getting crumble blocks to disappear with a wave/ext hyper  
- 2a intervention
- 5b cc pre spikejump
- 7a 0m 2crystal room: bkgd tile border for updash cue
- 7a 2500m fast key

#### Know the speed hierarchy  
This goes hand in hand with being conscious of bottlenecks. Know some of the nuanced properties of dashes, wallbounces, jumps, etc. Emphasis that dashing downwards, especially diagdown, can be deceptively slow for vertical bottleneck.  
If you updash near a wall, prefer wallbounce over climbjumping unless absolutely necessary (e.g., 5a tape room).

- 1a crossing-3, 7a 500m-2 right dash 
- 1a chasm2 ending
- 2a start near-end wallbounce
- 3a boxes final wallbounce
- 4a trail/cliff face wallbounces
- 5b cc-1 cornerglide
- 6a rb last badeline: instant hyper over ext hyper ultra
- 7a 1000m-2: dj upright, transition wallbounce (ties into dashcd)
- 7a 0m orb early right dash, fast fall
- 7a 0m orb: bkgd cue for left dash
- 7a 2500m avoid upright along the wall
- 7a 2500m door: only 1 downright

#### DashCD control  
Awareness of DashCD and movement to intentionally avoid or retain DashCD for setups. Selection of instant hyper, hyper bhop, vs ext-hyper. Buffering dashes out of DashCD, related to grounded ultra timing. Managing DashCD from vertical transitions (canceling vertical momentum, 3a-suite cutscene delay) and developing intuition for buffering out of vertical DashCD.

- 2a start before mirror: ext hyper
- 4a 1st block ultra
- 5b pillarful: ext hyper
- 6a hollows kevin slide
- 7a 1500m entering 1-coin room
- 7a 2500m cornerglide
- 7a 2500m orb entry springskip

#### Option-selecting movement  
Making decisions to cover multiple possible outcomes in case something unexpected happens with movement

#### Holding into the wall for wallkicks for forcemove  
- 3a start post triplat: hold left for wallkick
- 7a 3k flag14: wallkick while holding left

#### Using dash-attack leniency on wallbounces to hold toward a wall  
- 3a suite-1
- 4a start final
- 7a 500m-1

#### Pressing extra buttons to cover unexpected scenarios  
General cornerkicks: 2 jump inputs to cover weird timing  
Holding grab in case of missed landings  
- 3a shaft 1st berry room ending
- 7a 2000m pre-orb

#### Simple pausebuffer timing  
Learning to buffer the pause at the start of 2a-Intervention and 3a-Suite segways into learning bubsdrop. This will be the only pausebuffer strat learned in the habits, but also acts as a gateway for learning more complicated pausebuffer strats for those who wish to go further.

## Some Skit Ideas for Fun

- 2 jump button demonstration and try using SirNewt 27 any% example (3a shaft-1), get bamboozled
- Oshiro final: struggle with differences in entry vs death cycle at lv 2, attempt to learn a death cycle, brain blast trying to do death cycle on entry, decide to revert to level 1
- "Statistical anomaly" get owned by oshiro freezeframe in suite-4 trying to hyper bhop in lv 2 or 3, revisit in lv4 about optimizing dash to the coin
- Paid chatter asking about 5b, 6b, no demo weirdge
- Trying to instant hyper and pressing jump-dash instead of dash-jump, learning to apply sensitivity analysis (naively believe pressing jump+dash together results in super, find it doesn't always work, try perturbing timings and see what happens)
- Insist on ultras being easy to perform in a vacuum with good binds (lv 2 habits!!), criticize using face buttons only, share personal story of how both hand health and controller longevity improved dramatically when I switched to independent dash and jump binds
- 5b cc final updash: pretend to use flawed logic to setup 5f window (like apparent RPM but is actually a strong move), discuss how habits can't cover higher levels of learning with weird niche setups

## Closing Thoughts

Habits cap out as we approach higher levels of gameplay. In chess, a lot of the higher level learning becomes learning when to break the habits. My opinion is that in Celeste, further learning becomes paying attention to increasingly granular levels of detail, and trying to rely only on the fundamentals becomes limited.

Reflecting on the goals of the habits, the early levels started with developing mastery of the basic inputs, followed by learning to use speed tech. None of the speed tech is highly technical to perform: mainly learning the extension timing requires learning an arbitrary muscle-memory. Speed tech is only ever used in the context of having a plan or setup, and is only as hard as the setup demands.

Later levels focused on developing strats with consistency and keeping an open eye for optimizing movement. Level 4 began to dive into some of the more granular details, but my intent was to focus on movement themes that are commonly recurring to build pattern recognition.

Thank you for reading and (presumably) watching the series. I hope you found this both entertaining and instructive.

## FAQ

**Q: Why is x at habit level y? It should be in habit level z!**  
*A: Maybe, there's no one way to build a habits series. These just reflect my personal take and values on how to incrementally improve on the fundamentals. I think I did a pretty good job and being self-consistent.*

**Q: Why aren't you doing x strat at habit level y? It's easier and faster!**  
*A: Because I don't care about the time, I want to emphasize skillset development. If you find a different strat that you think is easier and faster, go ahead and do it.*

**Q: That strat was nice but you could have optimized it better by doing this.**  
*A: Sure, maybe I was aware of that, maybe I wasn't. If I intentionally excluded it, then I decided it wasn't worth the level of detail to explain in a fundamentals-based approach. If I didn't know about it...well hopefully it didn't egregiously violate any of the habits. I want to say I have a good enough grasp of the game where this might pop up occasionally but not be a major issue.*

**Q: Why not play 5b from Level 1? Why bother spending time learning 5a if we're just switching to 5b at Level 4?**  
*A: There is some merit to this idea, and a habits series could be viable starting with 5b from Level 1, but my justifications are the following:*
1. 5b presents too high of a barrier to entry in terms of the precision platforming.
2. 5b requires niche tech (pause-buffering, neutral spikejump) to save time over 5a. I originally did not want to ever introduce pause-buffering as it's a textbook example of only being useful in extremely niche situations. However, I decided that pause-buffering is still a useful skill to have and muscle memory to learn.
3. Search reverse super is a nice gateway to learning extension timing, just like how bubsdrop can be a gateway to learning more complex pause strats like 3a fast demo and 4a 2nd blockless.
4. With good fundamentals at Level 3, skills are transferable and learning 5b is not that different from learning new strats in 5a.

**Q: 6b when?**  
*A: Barrier to entry is simply too high. A habits run of 6b would mostly look like a casual playthrough with a "try not to die" mentality.*

**Q: This doesn't seem like a very efficient way of learning the speedrun. Why are we spending so much time not doing tech or learning setups?**  
*A: Depends on what you mean by efficient. You can maybe get faster times with less practice & learning by jumping straight to the hard stuff and monkey-brain copying strats and movement. My experience is that this usually only works if you have prior experience in speedrunning and learning how to learn. The goal of the habits is not about getting the fastest possible time, after all. Taking a long time to build a strong foundation.*

**Q: The goal of speedrunning is to get the fastest possible time. Why isn't this a goal of the habits?**  
*A: Because my opinion is that speedrunning Celeste is a performing art, and the final time you get is secondary. Without going into too much detail: time of course is important when selecting strats, learning movement, and developing a plan. These are implicitly considered as we build the habits to improve our speed, consistency, and optimize movement. Let the time follow your personal growth, no need to chase after the times.*
