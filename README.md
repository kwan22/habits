## Introduction
"Building habits" is originally a YouTube series from Grandmaster Aman Hambleton (Chessbrah) as both an educational and entertaining method to gradually improve at chess. Aman follows a strict set of rules to simulate playing at various levels of gameplay, from complete beginner to a fairly advanced level (0-2000 ELO). The rules are centered purely around the fundamental principles of playing good moves. The goal is not to always be playing optimally or win every game, but to focus on "high-percentage" moves that are usually but not always good. As the rating rises, the rules change to reflect the increase in the player's strength and understand the more nuanced situations of why sometimes the high-percentage moves aren't always good. Eventually, the habits series concludes at around 2000 ELO as the fundamentals can only take you so far, and attention to niche details and specific variations becomes increasingly important.

For those curious, [the chess series can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibDX4ReEikQ&list=PLUjxDD7HNNThwCNW3f36RZcMxPwQIjYae). Those familiar with chess and the rules will find parallels in this series. As a casual chess enjoyer and dedicated Celeste speedrunner, I've been inspired to attempt to apply this philosophy towards Celeste speedrunning. My approach to learning is also largely rooted in learning the fundamentals first before learning to break them. In summary, the goals of the Celeste habits are to:

- Master basic movement mechanics
- Develop transferable skillsets and knowledge 
- Pattern recognition of common setups

Note that "getting the fastest time we can" or anything along those lines is **not** an explicit goal of the habits. The philosophy here is that fast times will naturally follow upon mastery of the fundamentals. Just like in the chess habits, there will be 4 levels of habits, starting from a complete beginner, and compounding on skills and concepts focused on in previous levels. A key focus will be on **incremental learning**, where we gradually increase our skillsets and knowledge to not overwhelm ourselves with details.

All levels of the habits will follow two global rules:

### 1. Basic setups  
**Basic setups** refer to a setup that is simple to understand, easy to replicate at the corresponding level, and easy to diagnose when something goes wrong. The specifics of a setup can range from a broad action such as "wait for Oshiro to pass" or a more refined detail such as "line up on this corner." Niche setups that require specific knowledge that has no direct application anywhere else are avoided (e.g., 4a cpop). Whether these niche strats are good or not is irrelevant if they are not instructive to the fundamental principles we are trying to master.

Non-basic setups would include strats with pixel lineups or subpixel manip (climbing lineups for 3a demo), unintuitive setups with invisible details (4a cpop, 6a lakeskip), strats where it's not obvious where something went wrong (2a downwards cb), long pause-buffer setups requiring memorizing specifc pixels or frames, 2fs in general, etc. 

### 2. Never reset
**Never reset** is simple: the goal of the habits is to develop skillsets and knowledge, not to chase good filetimes. Resetting for a good pace is simply a waste of time in this context. We are here to play the game to learn the basics, evaluate if we are truly consistent at our strat selection, and diagnose patterns of strats that are repeat offenders of going wrong. The end time we achieve will naturally improve along our skillsets and knowledge.
