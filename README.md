# Building Habits: Improving on the Fundamentals of Celeste Speedrunning

---

## Introduction

*"Building habits" is originally a YouTube series from Grandmaster Aman Hambleton (Chessbrah) as both an educational and entertaining method to gradually improve at chess. Aman follows a strict set of rules to simulate playing at various levels of gameplay, from complete beginner to a fairly advanced level (0-2000 ELO). The rules are centered purely around the fundamental principles of playing good moves. The goal is not to always be playing optimally or win every game, but to focus on "high-percentage" moves that are usually but not always good. As the rating rises, the rules change to reflect the increase in the player's strength. Eventually, the habits series concludes at around 2000 ELO as the fundamentals can only take you so far, and attention to niche details and specific variations becomes increasingly important.*

As a casual chess enjoyer and dedicated Celeste speedrunner, I've been inspired to attempt to apply this philosophy towards Celeste speedrunning. My approach to learning is also largely rooted in learning the fundamentals first before learning to break them. In summary, the goals of the Celeste habits are to:

- Master basic movement mechanics in increments
- Develop transferable skillsets and knowledge of movement
- Pattern recognition of common setups for consistency
- Throttle intake of information

Note that "getting the fastest time we can" or anything along those lines is **not** an explicit goal of the habits. The philosophy here is that fast times will naturally follow upon mastery of the fundamentals. Just like in the chess habits, there will be 4 levels of habits, starting from a complete beginner, and compounding on skills and concepts learned in previous levels.

*(maybe screenshot of RandomName talking about my bingo routing following basic principles)*

All levels of the habits will follow two overarching principles:

### 1. Basic setups  
### 2. Never reset

**Basic setups** refer to a setup that is simple to understand and easy to replicate at the corresponding level. The specifics of a setup can range from a broad action such as "wait for Oshiro to pass" or a more refined detail such as "line up on this corner." Niche setups that require specific knowledge that has no direct application anywhere else are avoided (e.g., 4a cpop). Whether these niche strats are good or not is irrelevant if they are not instructive to the fundamental principles.

**Never reset** is simple: the goal of the habits is to develop skillsets and knowledge, not to chase good filetimes. Resetting for a good pace is simply a waste of time in this context. We are here to play the game to learn the basics, evaluate if we are truly consistent at our strat selection, and diagnose patterns of strats that are repeat offenders of going wrong. The end time we achieve is completely irrelevant.

Lastly, as a teaser, I will introduce the first habit:

### Level 0  
**Have fun.**

That's it, but really, this is probably the most critical habit to have. Everyone has their own meaning of what fun is and how they want to play the game. The rest of the habits will reflect my own values and skills I want to see in my own speedrunning. Enjoy.
