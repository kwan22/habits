**Q1: Why is x at habit level y? It should be in habit level z!**  <br>
*A: Maybe, there's no one way to build a good habits series. These just reflect my personal take and values on how to incrementally improve on the fundamentals.*

**Q2: Why aren't you doing x strat at habit level y? It's easier and faster!**  <br>
*A: Because I don't care about the time, I want to emphasize skillset development. If you find a different strat that you think is easier and faster, congrats, go ahead and do it to save time.*

**Q3: That strat was nice but you could have optimized it better by doing this.**  <br>
*A: Similar as above. Sure, maybe I was aware of that, maybe I wasn't. If I intentionally excluded it, then I decided it wasn't worth the level of detail to explain in a fundamentals-based approach. If I didn't know about it...well hopefully I didn't egregiously violate any of the habits by not including that detail. I want to say my peer reviewers and I have a good enough grasp of the game where this might pop up occasionally but not be a major issue.*

**Q4: Why isn't 5b implemented earlier?**  <br>
*A: This is just a specific instance of the first 2 questions but demands the most attention as there is a significant routing split here. Typically, 5b can save time by players around or potentially before Level 3, but they'll have to spend time learning bubsdrop and the neutral spikejump at minimum, not to mention all the other challenging rooms in the rest of 5b. The goal of the habits is not to get the fastest time possible, but to develop fundamentals incrementally. My opinion is that pausebuffering and buffered neutral cornerkicks (spikejump), the two key tricks to make 5b save time, are not suitable or instructive at Level 3. Even though these nominally do not require more technical precision than the extension timing introduced at Level 3 (~5f buffer window vs 5f extension window), these specific instances of buffering are deliberately not introduced at the same time as buffering as a concept in the first place. Let the player get their hands dirty first with some easier-to-see buffer setups like some of the spikejumps introduced at level 3. I also want to develop a feel for buffering actions out of transition (transition tech, 2a-intervention-1 + 3a-suite-final cutscenes) first before attempting pausebuffered bubsdrop in a higher stakes scenario. With the way I sorted the other learning aspects of the game, I felt it was best to introduce 5b at Level 4. Outside of these two tricks, the typically beginner-challenging rooms in the rest of 5b (CC cycles, TTM pillars, MM2+3) are just much easier to deal with at Level 4.*

**Q5: What would habits level 5 look like?**  <br>
*A: The habits stop making sense after Level 4, as further improvement becomes understanding all of the little details specific to every situation. Level 4 itself is already stretching the limits of the habits, but we covered some important principles relevant to both movement and consistency.*

**Q6: 6b when?**  <br>
*A: Barrier to entry is simply too high. A habits run of 6b would mostly look like a casual playthrough with a "try not to die" mentality until Level 4 at least.*

**Q: This doesn't seem like a very efficient way of learning the speedrun. Why are we spending so much time not doing tech or fast strats so we can start building muscle memory earlier?**  <br>
*A: Depends on what you mean by efficient. No need to rip out all the hard strats when you don't even have control of basic jump+dash+grab combos or any movement fluidity. Beginners barely even know how to control Madeline, what are we doing learning difficult strats from the get-go? 

**Q7: What are the goal times for each level?** <br>
*A: Doesn't matter, the goal is to develop skillsets and knowledge, not target arbitrary filetimes. The reader can have their own interpretation on what the corresponding fullgame times would be.*

**Q8: The goal of speedrunning is to get the fastest possible time. Why isn't this a goal of the habits?**  <br>
*A: Because my opinion is that speedrunning Celeste is a performing art, and the final time you get is secondary. Time of course is important when selecting strats, learning movement, and developing a plan. These are implicitly considered as we build the habits to improve our speed, consistency, and optimize movement. Once these are settled and we enter the mode of running fullgame, the focus should shift to whether we are executing our plan as intended or not. The time simply becomes a consequence of our performance at this point. Let the end time follow your personal growth, no need to chase after arbitrary filetimes.*
