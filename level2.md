# Level 2

<img src = "https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv2.png" width = "960">

Level 2 is meant to simulate a player that has likely already dabbled in speedrunning Celeste and wants to take it more seriously. Perhaps they have completed all the chapters or even 100%'d the game. Here, we nominally unleash the basic speed tech taught in the game. Use of speedrun tool is recommended.

## Basic tech
This includes supers, hypers, wallbounces, and wavedashes. I specify wavedash here as it is taught in Farewell, while extended hypers are not. A small but key distinction: we will not strictly know the timing for extensions. The one and only exception to this will be the reverse super in Search. This will be our launching pad to learn extension timing in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Hypers and wavedashes</summary>
  Some examples of where basic speed tech is useful and provides large returns on timesave.<br>

  <summary>Wallbounces</summary>
  Wallbounces at Level 2 improve vertical speed over climbjumping and occasionally enable some skips. <br>

  <summary>Supers</summary>
  Without having fully learned extension timing and only following the advice of wavedash.ppt, supers have limited use. As extension timing will become an integral part at higher levels of gameplay, we will instead use Search skip to provide visual guidance on learning extension timing. <br>
    <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv2/5a_search_skip_slow.webp" width="480"/> <br>
    We can learn extension timing by lining up on the left wall, dashing right, and waiting until we hit the right wall before turning around and jumping for Search skip reverse super. This is about as accurate as wavedash.ppt is at teaching wavedashes, i.e. technically incorrect but sufficient for our purposes. The goal here is to provide a single, isolated case to practice extension (and reverse) timings, with a simple visual cue to guide the arbitrary timing.

  <summary>Theo</summary>
  Access to supers and hypers opens up some more movement options with Theo. Learn to throw Theo and super or hyper into him. Note that when throwing Theo and hypering into him, there is a bit of delay before initiating the hyper as the hyper has less height, whereas the super can be started immediately.<br>

  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv2/5a_rescue_theohyper.webp" width="480"/> <br>
Be cognizant of when you have leeway to throw and hyper, whether it be seekers or even in the eyeball room. Reckless movement in eyeball room will not do you any favors even if you don't die. <br>

  Note the red-dot principle we follow against the eyeball waves.

## Introduction to active movement
With hyper-speed unlocked, we can simplify some rooms using active movement. For now, active movement means being aware of the what next room is when exiting the current room, and consciously performing movement into that room.

<details>
  <summary>Active movement</summary>
  Begin to apply active movement to simplify some rooms, commonly by hypering near transition into the next room.<br>

  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv2/7a_2500m_wave.webp" width="480"/>

  While the notion of active movement is still in its early stages, we still must be ready for the red-dot at all times.

## Ergonomic binds  
This means having dash (or demo), 2 jump binds, and grab on keys that can all be pressed and released independently of each other. This also means we will be using the 2 jump buttons for any vertical movement. Bind a menu down-confirm bind for retry and skip cutscene.

<details>
  <summary>2 jump binds</summary>

  The ability to press jump without releasing it is **one of the most fundamental aspects to vertical movement**. I avoided this in Level 1 to keep the number of action inputs to the 3 main ones, but for those looking to take speedrunning more seriously, this is best learned early. Use 1 jump button to initiate a first jump input, keep it held, and press the 2nd jump for subsequent jumps. Build this habit as early as you can! Don't be afraid to rebind and relearn gradually if you haven't adopted this habit yet. Go slow at first if you need to: you may be slower at first than mashing 1 jump button, but you will gradually improve over time. <br>

  Input display is provided here. Notice how "Jump2" is pressed first and held the entire time, while "Jump1" is pressed for subsequent jumps.

## One cycle only  
Retransition if possible to reset the entry cycle. The goal is to reinforce learning of the entry cycle via repetition and avoid having to learn different strats for the same room. (If re-entry is not possible, wait to resync or revert to level 1)
