## Level 2

Level 2 is meant to simulate a player that has likely already dabbled in speedrunning Celeste and wants to take it more seriously. Perhaps they have completed all the chapters or even 100%'d the game. Here, we nominally unleash the basic speed tech taught in the game. Use of speedrun tool is recommended.

#### Basic dash tech  
This includes supers, hypers, wallbounces, and wavedashes. I specify wavedash here as it is taught in Farewell, while extended hypers are not. A small but key distinction: we will not know the timing for extensions. The one and only exception to this will be the reverse super in Search. This will be our launching pad to learn extension timing in the future.

#### Basic entity tech  
This includes dream jumps, fastbubbling, using bubbles as dashes, archie, and setups for liftboost in ways not seen in Level 1 (think of block hyper in Shrine).

#### One cycle only  
Retransition if possible to reset the entry cycle. The goal is to reinforce learning of the entry cycle via repetition and avoid having to learn different strats for the same room. (If re-entry is not possible, revert to level 1, reveal as part of a skit?)

#### Good, ergonomic binds  
This means having dash (or demo), 2 jump binds, and grab on keys that can all be pressed and released independently of each other. This also means we will be using the 2 jump buttons for any vertical movement.
