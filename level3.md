## Level 3

Level 3 rounds out most of the RTA-viable speed tech that most speedrunners will ever encounter. We emphasize a selection of strats with speed generation/conservation, and finding ways to perform them in a consistent manner via normalization. Use of speedrun tool is highly recommended.

#### Extension timing  
Perhaps the true bread and butter of Celeste speed tech. If you have to pick one arbitrary rhythm/timing in this game to memorize for speedrunning, it is this timing. Mastery of the reverse super from Level 2 should have built the dash-to-jump timing into muscle memory that we now utilize more broadly.

#### Ultras, CBs, demos, neutrals, cornerkicks  
Some scary words for beginners but none of these are actually difficult if you know extension timing. We are just starting to implement some setups to use these where they are most friendly to being consistent.

- **Ultras:** 2a start, awake, 3a hub1, boxes1, 4a start, 2nd block ultra 5a depths-1
- **Cornerboosts:** 1a r2, 2a intervention near end, 3a start past 1st door, 5a start 3, 6a hollows-1, 7a 2500m-1 archie
- **Demos:** 2a awake demohypers, 3a shaft 8f setup
- **Neutrals:** 1a chasm left wall, 6a hollows
- **Cornerkick:** 1a chasm left wall, 2a intervention, 4a shrine, 7a 500m, 3000m

#### Active movement  
No more entering a room and then starting movement, movement exiting a room should consciously chain into the next room. Cycles or other moviong hazards should also become largely irrelevant or incorporated into the movement when strats are well executed (many cycle rooms in 3a, 1500m; seekers/snowballs, many transition super/hyper/wallbounce).

#### Normalization with leniency  
The goal is to make strats more consistent. The transition hyper and wallbounce will be the most common for using the buffer system and introducing normalization. Other movement and setups that emphasize using the buffer system include spikejumps, dream hypers/doublejumps, and pausing for some cutscene skips (gateway to lv 4 pausebuffering).  
Cornercorrection is a mechanic that will be naturally used at all levels, but here we will intentionally use it to mostly emphasize that 3-tile jumps line up well for midair supers, and both 1- and 2-tile hypers line up well with midair supers (or demohypers) because of cornercorrection. Jumpthrough cornercorrection leniency is also demonstrated. This is also a place to learn the timing for dashing out of max height and not releasing jump while doing so.

-**Buffer setups:** 1a chasm spikejump, 2a cutscene skip, 3a spikejump, rooftop cutscenes, 4a spikejump, wallbounce
- **Cornercorrection:** 1a start-1, 2a start+awake, 3a shaft final, 3a suite final, 4a cliff face-2, 5a rescue-3, 6a resolution, 7a flag1
