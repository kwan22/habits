# Level 3

<img src = "https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3.png" width = "960">

Level 3 rounds out most of the RTA-viable speed tech that most speedrunners will ever encounter. We emphasize a selection of strats with speed generation/conservation, and finding ways to perform them in a consistent manner via normalization.

## Extension timing  
Perhaps the true bread and butter of Celeste speed tech. If you have to pick one arbitrary timing in this game to memorize for speedrunning, it is this timing. Mastery of the reverse super from Level 2 should have built the dash-to-jump timing into muscle memory that we now utilize more broadly. Many wavedashes can be replaced with extended hypers by removing the "need" to jump before downdiagonal dashing as taught in wavedash.ppt.

## Basic leniency and normalization
The goal is to take advantage of various leniency mechanics offered in Celeste to open up more movement options and normalization methods. These leniency mechanics are used at all levels of play, perhaps unintentionally for beginners, but now we begin to be more conscious of using them.

<details>
  <summary>Transition buffers</summary>
  Dash through a transition and jump after to perform the dash tech across the screen transition. One of the best ways to normalize movement. <br>

  Pausing for cutscene skips on transition can be buffered in v1.4. When executed correctly, the pause menu should appear at the end of transition and before Madeline moves. <br>

  While missing the buffer out of transition is largely inconsequential for cutscene skips, these are useful diagnostics as they provides instant feedback to evaluate if you are properly buffering out of the transition.

<details>
  <summary>Cornercorrection</summary>
  Cornercorrection and floorsnapping are leniency mechanics that will be naturally used at all levels, but here we will intentionally emphasize movement where lining up a midair dash for cornercorrection is lenient. Jumpthrough correction leniency is also demonstrated. This is also a nice place to learn the timing for dashing at or near max height and not releasing jump while doing so. A jump lines up well with a 3-tile height platform, and a hyper lines up well with both 1-tile and 2-tile height platforms. <br>

    <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3/7a_2k_start_cut.webp" width="480">    

  Jumpthroughs, moving platforms, and clouds are even more forgiving with cornercorrection.<br>

  Flag 1 has the gauntlet of cornercorrection. Many of the platform heights line up well with combinations of jumps, updashes, and updiagonal dashes. <br>

<details>
  <summary>Buffer setups</summary>
  Gradual introduction of the buffer mechanic with some setups that rely heavily on buffering to be viable. Jumps on or near spikes ("spikejumps") are common examples. The timesave from these is cool but not important: these are more useful as diagnostics in that the strat fails with improper buffering. <br>

## Advanced techniques
The use of "advanced" here mostly implies a technique not naturally taught by the game. Players will likely need to have done some external research to learn about these. Keep in mind that there is nothing inherently new about each technique. At the end of the day, everything is some combination of pressing jump, dash, and grab. It is the setup on which these are used that can be challenging to make successful.
<details>
  <summary>Hyper bhop</summary>
  Hyper with a short jump to return to the ground quickly, and jump (bhop) again for a small speed boost. This is frequently the fastest way to accelerate from a standstill, and may provide some small optimizations over a simple hyper. When well executed in the right situations, it can effectively provide the horizontal speed of a hyper and the vertical speed of a bhop.<br>

<details>
  <summary>Ultras</summary>
  Collide with the ground after a downdiagonal dash to gain a 1.2x horizontal speed multiplier. Requires a minimum elevation drop of almost 4 tiles from the start of the downdiagonal dash, or an interaction that cancels the dash (e.g. Theo) to preserve the speed. Commonly performed using an extended hyper into downdiagonal. Avoid buffering jump on landing if possible.<br>

  <summary>Cornerboosts </summary>
  Buffer a climbjump near a corner to gain a small speed boost. Getting the speed boost may contain "rng" depending on the setup. <br>

  An in-game bind since v1.4; dash with a crouching hitbox. Enables some skips, opens up movement options, and adds leniency in some cases. <br>

  <summary>Neutrals</summary>
  Jump off a wall without holding grab or any horizontal directions. Can be used to ascend without spending stamina or normalize horizontal trajectory from a walljump or wallbounce. <br>

## Cues

Many scary-looking strats become less scary with the right (visual) cue, typically a notable background tile or decal. Cues act as a more convenient target point to jump or dash from, usually one that Madeline passes closer to, rather than looking at the true target which might be less intuitive to aim at. Leniency mechanics often come into play here. 

<details>
  <summary>Example 1: 4a Cliff face</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3/4a_cf_1tile_ultra.webp" width="480">
  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3/4a_cf_1tile_ultra.png" width="480"> <br>
  This scary-looking ultra onto the 1-tile is easier than it looks: the downright lines up nicely above the previous platform. Personally I aim for when Madeline is vertically aligned with the jutting background tiles as they're closer to Madeline and easier to see. The right dash afterwards is lined up at full height. Slow climb to the top, and then demohyper and the last snowball lines up.

  <summary>Example 2: 5a Rescue</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3/5a_rescue_eyecue.webp" width="480">
  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3/5a_rescue_eyecue.png" width="480"> <br>
  Big speed strat is much easier than it looks. Extended hyper from the previous room, hold grab and downright dash upon transition, and then the throw + midair super at the small eyeball in the background. Note the platform we're midair-supering off of is 3 tiles off the ground. Sound familiar?
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Example 3: 6a Reflection</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3/6a_reflection_shortcut3.webp" width="480">
  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3/6a_reflection_shortcut3.png" width="480"> <br>
  The gap for this final shortcut stays off camera until you get quite close to it, making it difficult to react. Incidentally, the right edge of the gap perfectly lines up with the left side of the flower. This means we should aim to be just to the left of the flower. Whatever movement you decide to do to approach this gap, we can use the flower as a reference to judge our alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Example 4: 7a 1000m</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3/7a_1k_orb_upleft.webp" width="480">
  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3/7a_1k_orb_upleft.png" width="480"> <br>
  The background tile acts as a nice reference point to aim this upleft through both dreamblocks. It turns out that this upleft cannot be too early: the earliest possible dash is viable, aka it's bufferable! (If you press dash too early, nothing happens). 
</details>

[Koralreef's cue collection](https://koralreeef.github.io/info.html) has a large selection of visual cues as well. When you're struggling to perform a strat, a visual cue might help anchor your plan.

## Active movement  
Movement should flow from one segment to the next. Movement exiting a room should consciously chain into the next room. Strats are designed such that avoiding hazards is incorporated into the movement when well executed. Transition tech commonly serves as an anchor point of normalization for movement across rooms. Time spent standing still and reacting to the room should be minimized. This is largely enabled by leniency mechanics and often combines them in various ways.
<details>
  <summary>Examples showcasing active movement</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3/3a_start_triplat_active.webp" width="480">
  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3/3a_suite_final.webp" width="480"> <br>
  Note the use of transition buffers and cornercorrection. Active movement is applicable literally everywhere, but has the most visually obvious impact on movement through dynamic hazards. With good active movement, we don't need to worry about cycles or red-dot since those should be incorporated into the movement. However, if anything goes wrong and we get off-cycle, then the red-dot can strike at any time. <br>
