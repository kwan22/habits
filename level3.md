## Level 3

Level 3 rounds out most of the RTA-viable speed tech that most speedrunners will ever encounter. We emphasize a selection of strats with speed generation/conservation, and finding ways to perform them in a consistent manner via normalization. Use of speedrun tool is highly recommended.

#### Extension timing  
Perhaps the true bread and butter of Celeste speed tech. If you have to pick one arbitrary rhythm/timing in this game to memorize for speedrunning, it is this timing. Mastery of the reverse super from Level 2 should have built the dash-to-jump timing into muscle memory that we now utilize more broadly. Many wavedashes can be replaced with extended hypers by removing the "need" to jump.

#### Normalization and leniency  
The goal is to make strats and movement more consistent by taking advantage of various leniency mechanics offered in Celeste. These leniency mechanics are used at all levels of play, perhaps unintentionally for beginners, but now we begin to be more conscious of using them.

  <summary>Transition buffers</summary>
  Dash through a transition and jump after to perform the dash tech across the screen transition. One of the best ways to normalize movement. <br>

  Pausing for cutscene skips on transition can be buffered in v1.4. When executed correctly, the pause menu should appear at the end of transition and before Madeline moves. <br>

  Buffering pause out of transition for cutscene skips isn't always optimal, but it is for these two cases.

  <summary>Cornercorrection and floorsnapping: </summary>
  These are leniency mechanics that will be naturally used at all levels, but here we will intentionally emphasize movement where lining up a midair dash for cornercorrection is lenient. Jumpthrough correction leniency is also demonstrated. This is also a nice place to learn the timing for dashing at or near max height and not releasing jump while doing so. <br>

  <img src="https://github.com/kwan22/habits/blob/main/images/lv3/2a_awake_3tile_1.png" width="480"> <br>
From a standstill, a hyper lines up well with a 1-tile or 2-tile platform. A jump lines up well with a 3-tile platform.

Some examples of movement where midair lineups are lenient thanks to cornercorrection. <br>

  <summary>Buffer setups</summary>
  Gradual introduction of the buffer mechanic with some setups that rely heavily on buffering to be viable. Jumps on or near spikes ("spikejumps") are common examples. <br>

#### Advanced techniques
The use of "advanced" here mostly implies a technique not naturally taught by the game. Runners will likely need to have done some external research to learn about these. Keep in mind that the difficulty of the technique, beyond the potential increase in input density from before, is largely dependent on the setup in which it is used.

  <summary>Hyper bhop: hyper with a short jump to return to the ground quickly, and jump (bhop) again for a small speed boost. This is frequently the fastest way to accelerate from a standstill, and may provide some small optimizations over a simple large hyper. When well executed and given enough space, it can effectively provide the horizontal speed of a hyper and the vertical speed of a bhop.</summary>

  <summary>Ultras: collide with the ground after a downdiagonal dash ends to gain a 1.2x speed multiplier. Requires a minimum elevation change of almost 4 tiles or an interaction that cancels the dash (e.g. cutscenes, Theo). Commonly performed using an extended hyper into downdiagonal</summary>

#### Active movement  
Movement should flow from one segment to the next. Movement exiting a room should consciously chain into the next room. Strats are designed such that avoiding hazards is incorporated into the movement when well executed. Transition tech commonly serves as an anchor point of normalization for movement across rooms. Time spent standing still should be minimized. This is largely enabled by leniency mechanics and often combines them in various ways.

  Note the use of transition tech and leniency mechanics, including cornercorrection and buffering. With good active movement, we don't need to worry about red-dot since it should be incorporated into the movement. However, if anything goes wrong and we get off-cycle, then red-dot can strike at any time.
