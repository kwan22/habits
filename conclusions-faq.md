## Closing Thoughts

Habits cap out as we approach higher levels of gameplay. In chess, a lot of the higher level learning becomes learning when to break the habits. My opinion is that in Celeste, further learning becomes paying attention to increasingly granular levels of detail, and trying to rely only on the fundamentals becomes limited.

Reflecting on the goals of the habits, the early levels started with developing mastery of the basic inputs, followed by learning to use speed tech. None of the speed tech is highly technical to perform: mainly learning the extension timing requires learning an arbitrary muscle-memory. Speed tech is only ever used in the context of having a plan or setup, and is only as hard as the setup demands.

Later levels focused on developing strats with consistency and keeping an open eye for optimizing movement. Level 4 began to dive into some of the more granular details, but my intent was to focus on movement themes that are commonly recurring to build pattern recognition.

Thank you for reading and (presumably) watching the series. I hope you found this both entertaining and instructive.

## FAQ

**Q: Why is x at habit level y? It should be in habit level z!**  
*A: Maybe, there's no one way to build a good habits series. These just reflect my personal take and values on how to incrementally improve on the fundamentals.*

**Q: Why aren't you doing x strat at habit level y? It's easier and faster!**  
*A: Because I don't care about the time, I want to emphasize skillset development. If you find a different strat that you think is easier and faster, congrats, go ahead and do it to save time.*

**Q: That strat was nice but you could have optimized it better by doing this.**  
*A: Similar as above. Sure, maybe I was aware of that, maybe I wasn't. If I intentionally excluded it, then I decided it wasn't worth the level of detail to explain in a fundamentals-based approach. If I didn't know about it...well hopefully I didn't egregiously violate any of the habits by not including that detail. I want to say my peer reviewers and I have a good enough grasp of the game where this might pop up occasionally but not be a major issue. Reference Aman's Qg4 and 'no need to be a hero' clips*

**Q: Why not play 5b from Level 1? Why bother spending time learning 5a if we're just switching to 5b at Level 4?**  
*A: There is some merit to this idea, and a habits series could be viable starting with 5b from Level 1, but my justifications are the following:*
1. 5b presents a high barrier to entry that simply isn't necessary at a beginner level.
2. 5b requires niche tech (pause-buffering, neutral spikejump) to save time over 5a in the first place. I originally did not want to ever introduce pause-buffering as it's a textbook example of only being useful in extremely niche situations. However, I decided that pause-buffering is still a useful skill to have and muscle memory to learn at the highest habits level.
3. Search skip is a nice gateway to learning extension timing, just like how bubsdrop can be a gateway to learning more complex pause strats like 3a fast demo and 4a 2nd blockless for those looking to push further beyond the habits, as well as performing some basic science.
4. With good fundamentals at Level 3, skills are transferable and learning 5b is not that different from learning more in 5a.

**Q: 6b when?**  
*A: Barrier to entry is simply too high. A habits run of 6b would mostly look like a casual playthrough with a "try not to die" mentality.*

**Q: This doesn't seem like a very efficient way of learning the speedrun. Why are we spending so much time not doing tech or learning setups?**  
*A: Depends on what you mean by efficient. Because I've seen one too many people rip out crazy strats but don't even have control of basic jump+dash+grab combos or have any basic movement fluidity. Reference Aman's Level 1 'don't even know where the pieces go' and 'look back at old games filled with tactics' clips as examples why tech isn't in level 1: you barely even know how to control Madeline, what are you doing trying to go fast.*

**Q: What are the goal times for each level?** 
*A: Doesn't matter, the goal is to develop skillsets and knowledge, not target arbitrary filetimes. The reader can have their own interpretation on what the corresponding fullgame times would be.*

**Q: The goal of speedrunning is to get the fastest possible time. Why isn't this a goal of the habits?**  
*A: Because my opinion is that speedrunning Celeste is a performing art, and the final time you get is secondary. Time of course is important when selecting strats, learning movement, and developing a plan. These are implicitly considered as we build the habits to improve our speed, consistency, and optimize movement. Once these are settled and we enter the mode of running fullgame, the focus should shift to whether we are executing our plan as intended or not. The time simply becomes a consequence of our performance at this point. Let the end time follow your personal growth, no need to chase after arbitrary filetimes.*
